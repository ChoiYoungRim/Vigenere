# Vigenere

This decoding program is made in Ubuntu Linux and able to be compiled by GCC. This program can decode a text encoded by Vigenere. If you want to run this program, do 'gcc -o [EXECUTE_FILE_NAME] vigenere.c' and just do './[EXECUTE_FILE_NAME]'.

The example text file has to be written in capitals and its encoded type must be Vigenere.
